This is the dataset I used for the text classification: https://huggingface.co/datasets/gretelai/symptom_to_diagnosis . Using a fine-tuned version of BERT, a test accuracy of 96% was obtained.
Another dataset, which has more data, but only has numerical labels and not text labels, is: https://huggingface.co/datasets/duxprajapati/symptom-disease-dataset/viewer/default/train
