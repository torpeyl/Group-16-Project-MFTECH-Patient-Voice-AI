# Group-16-Project-MFTECH-Patient-Voice-AI
This project is a colaboration between Medical Frontier Technology and Imperial College London students. The final product is a website that takes a voice recording of a patient describing their symptoms, and outputs various indicators that can help the patient and doctor determine the patient's state of health, as well as whether the patient needs further consultation and treatment.
## Navigating the repository
- The Web-Application folder contains the files to run the website.
- The Model-Training includes the files to produce model files/model weights.

Model files and weights may have to be produced and used with the web-application for the web-application to work.
