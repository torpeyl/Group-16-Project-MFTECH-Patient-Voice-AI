# Group-16-Project-MFTECH-Patient-Voice-AI
This project is a colaboration between Medical Frontier Technology and Imperial College London students. The final product is a website that takes a voice recording of a patient describing their symptoms, and outputs various indicators that can help the patient and doctor determine the patient's state of health, as well as whether the patient needs further consultation and treatment.
## Navigating the repository
- The `Flask_App` folder contains the files to run the website.
- The `Model-Training` folder includes the code to train the models and produce model files or weights.

To run the web application, the model weights for the disease classifier need to be regenerated from running `disease_classification.ipynb`.
